# Remote_health_monitoring

The analytical Dashboard  is mainly built from the insights gained from the User's health parameters using IBM services. The App demonstartes two main usecases of each for IBM IOT platform and Watson Studio as follows:
## Continuous Monitoring: 
  The main health parameters such as Body temperature, Heart beat and Blood pressure are continuosly collected with help of IBM IOT platform and displayed in dashboard. Even just from these parameters we can identify our health state. For example the ideal body temperature range is 97-99 Â°F ,Heart beat range 60-100 beats/min is and Blood Pressure range is 90/60-120/80 mmHg. 
 
## Alert on abnormalities:
Some times we cannot directly know about abnormalities from parameters or we may not able to monitor continuosuly, at that time machine learning helps us by giving alert during abnormal conditions. The machine learning model is trained with the historical data gained from our health data to detect any change in health state. It is personalized for each person so it will easily learn from person and alert them before hand so that he/she can take precautionary measures or to can consult the doctor to avoid serious problems.
